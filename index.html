<h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>
<p>This page introduces a few interesting animals and how they relate to different parts of web design.</p>

<h2>The Llama</h2>
<p>The Llama loves anything organized. Whenever she sees a list, she walks over calmly and inspects each item with care, as if evaluating its usefulness.</p>

<h2>The Anaconda</h2>
<p>The Anaconda is fast and sneaky. He uses anchor tags to silently move through the page without being noticed until it’s too late.</p>

<h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>
<p>
  Two things that matter a lot to me are <strong>consistency</strong> and <strong>progress</strong>.
  I try to stay focused on small wins every day because even if things feel slow, <em>moving forward still counts</em>.
